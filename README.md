# Pixel Art
This project is a single webpage comprised of a few buttons and a drawing area. By clicking once on the drawing area "easel," users are able to draw by dragging their cursor across the easel. If they click again, drawing will stop. There is also an "erase" mode, a "clear all" button, and an interactive color picker, which will change the color the user is drawing with.
